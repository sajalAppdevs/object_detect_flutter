# Edge Detection Example

A Flutter application that demonstrates real-time object edge detection and image cropping capabilities. This project provides a practical implementation of document scanning functionality using both camera feed and gallery images.

## Features

- Real-time edge detection using device camera
- Image cropping based on detected edges
- Support for both camera capture and gallery image selection
- Document scanning capabilities
- Automatic edge enhancement and perspective correction
- Easy-to-use interface for capturing and processing images

## Requirements

- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Android device/emulator (API 21 or higher)
- iOS device/simulator (iOS 11.0 or higher)
- Camera and storage permissions

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object_detect_flutter.git
   cd object_detect_flutter
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the app
2. Choose between camera capture or gallery image selection
3. Position the document within the camera frame or select an image
4. The app will automatically detect edges
5. Adjust the corners if needed
6. Confirm to crop and process the image

## Permissions

This app requires the following permissions:
- Camera access for real-time scanning
- Storage access for saving processed images
- Internet access for app functionality
